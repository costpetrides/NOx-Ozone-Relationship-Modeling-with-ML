# NOx-Ozone-Relationship-Modeling-with-ML
This repository contains machine learning models for analyzing and predicting the nonlinear relationship between NOx (nitrogen oxides) and ozone concentrations. It includes implementations of methods such as regression analysis, support vector machines, random forests, and neural networks to capture complex dependencies in environmental data.
----

When modeling the relationship between NOx (nitrogen oxides) and ozone concentrations using machine learning, you have several powerful model types to choose from. Hereâ€™s a rundown of some of the best approaches:

1. **Linear Regression**:
   - **Pros**: Simple, interpretable, and good for understanding basic relationships.
   - **Cons**: May not capture complex, non-linear relationships well.

2. **Decision Trees**:
   - **Pros**: Can model non-linear relationships and interactions between variables.
   - **Cons**: Prone to overfitting; may not generalize well to new data without pruning or ensemble methods.

3. **Random Forests**:
   - **Pros**: Combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness; reduces overfitting.
   - **Cons**: Less interpretable than individual decision trees; can be computationally intensive.

4. **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**:
   - **Pros**: Powerful and can capture complex patterns; includes models like XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.
   - **Cons**: More complex and can be sensitive to hyperparameter tuning.

5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**:
   - **Pros**: Effective in high-dimensional spaces and can model non-linear relationships using kernel functions.
   - **Cons**: Computationally intensive; may require careful tuning of parameters.

6. **Neural Networks**:
   - **Pros**: Highly flexible and capable of modeling very complex relationships; deep learning approaches (e.g., CNNs, RNNs) can be used if you have large amounts of data.
   - **Cons**: Requires large datasets; less interpretable and more computationally demanding.

7. **Gaussian Process Regression**:
   - **Pros**: Provides probabilistic predictions and can model complex relationships with uncertainty estimates.
   - **Cons**: Computationally expensive and scales poorly with large datasets.

8. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:
   - **Pros**: Simple and non-parametric; can adapt to local patterns in the data.
   - **Cons**: Computationally intensive for large datasets; performance can degrade with high-dimensional data.

9. **Autoencoders**:
   - **Pros**: Can be used for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction; useful in capturing complex patterns.
   - **Cons**: Requires careful tuning and might be overkill for simpler relationships.
